# Simple NOC

This projects aims to be Simple Network Operation Center for networks with large amount of network devices. Inspired by NOC Project, which, I think, is a great tool, but in my opinion is very bloated.

## Roadmap

* v0.1
  * IPAM
  * You can add network polls to the system
  * Network icmp scan for available devices
  * Configurable ping check for availability
  * Show poll capacity
* v0.2
  * Device inventory
  * Associating IP with the device
  * Interacting with device by SNMP
  * Recognizing device model
* v0.3
  * Interacting with devices via Telnet
  * Ability to parse device information via Telnet
